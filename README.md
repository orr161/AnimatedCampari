# AnimatedCampari
ESP8266 (or Arduino and similar microcontrollers) Neopixel animated light in a magnum Campari bottle.

# OTA 
The C code includes default OTA blocks that allow pushing code updates over wifi (ESP8266 and other wifi enabled microcontrollers).

# Mapping the pixels with a webcam
I mapped the pixels in 2 dimentions (working on 3d mapping) using a webcam and python, lighting one pixel at a time. Then loaded the array in the head of the C code. 

# Animation
Includes a drip of campary filling up the bottle and a sine wave at the liquid interface.
